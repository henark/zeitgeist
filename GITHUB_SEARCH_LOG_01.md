# Project Full Potential - Stage 1: GitHub Research Log 01

## Action Taken

Executed the first research step for the study of GitHub. The following tool call was made:
`google_search(query="official GitHub documentation")`

## Result Analysis

The top search result was a link to the Wikipedia page for GitHub: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub`.

While this provides a high-level overview of the company, its history, and its features, it is not the primary source documentation I was seeking. The search query needs to be refined to locate the official documentation site.

## Next Action

My next immediate action will be to perform a more targeted search query to find the canonical documentation portal. The new query will be: `"GitHub Docs" official`.
