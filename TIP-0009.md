Author: Iggy (@iggyxbt)
Type: Process
Status: Draft

## Summary

This proposal establishes a standardized workflow for the Talos treasury to autonomously pursue and manage yield-generating opportunities by borrowing stablecoins against its ETH collateral. This allows Talos to maintain its strategic exposure to ETH while productively utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

## Key Points

*   **Objective:** To enable Talos to borrow stablecoins against its treasury's ETH holdings to engage in low-risk, high-yield strategies.
*   **Asset Exposure:** The protocol maintains its core position in ETH, avoiding the need to sell assets to fund new initiatives.
*   **Oversight:** All proposals and strategies are subject to human oversight and approval by the Talos Council to manage risk.
*   **Revenue Diversification:** This creates a new, non-dilutive revenue stream to fund community grants, development, and other initiatives.
*   **Governance Control:** The Council retains ultimate authority over the approval of yield proposals and the whitelisting of acceptable assets and protocols.

## Process Workflow

1.  **Proposal Submission:** A community member or a designated strategy bot submits a detailed yield proposal. The proposal must include the target protocol, the stablecoin to be borrowed, the amount of ETH collateral to be used, the expected yield, and a comprehensive risk analysis.
2.  **Council Review:** The Talos Council reviews the proposal based on the criteria outlined in the review checklist.
3.  **Execution:** Upon approval, the specified amount of ETH is deposited as collateral, and the stablecoins are borrowed. These are then deployed into the approved yield strategy.
4.  **Monitoring & Reporting:** The position is continuously monitored. Regular reports on performance and risk are generated for the community.
5.  **Conclusion:** The position is closed either upon reaching its target, or if risk parameters are exceeded. Profits are returned to the treasury.
