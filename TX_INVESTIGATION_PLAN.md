# Transaction Hash Investigation Plan

This document outlines the plan to investigate the transaction hash `0xf56abc3ea096cffa6ab171a145d648215942952efbd8ab73214df5e12fb65251` on the Intuition Systems testnet.

## Step 1: Construct URL

The URL for viewing the transaction on the block explorer has been constructed:
`https://testnet.explorer.intuition.systems/tx/0xf56abc3ea096cffa6ab171a145d648215942952efbd8ab73214df5e12fb65251`

## Step 2: Access and Analyze

The next step is to access this URL using a web browsing tool. The content of the page will be analyzed to extract the following information:
*   Sender (`from`) and Receiver (`to`) addresses.
*   Value of any native token transferred.
*   Details of any `tTRUST` / `wETH` token transfers.
*   The function call and parameters, if it is a smart contract interaction.

This plan is now ready for execution.
