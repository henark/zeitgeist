# BitcoinMessageTools: Exploration Plan

This document outlines the initial exploration plan for the `shadowy-pycoder/BitcoinMessageTools` repository. This investigation will provide practical context to our theoretical discussions on cryptographic proof and identity.

## Phase 1: Initial Exploration Targets

The first step of the investigation will be a high-level exploration of the repository to understand its structure, dependencies, and purpose. The primary targets for this phase are:

1.  **`README.md`:** This is the most critical file for initial understanding. It will be read to learn about the tool's official description, its features, and to find usage examples for signing and verifying messages.

2.  **Dependency Files:** Files like `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` will be analyzed to identify the project's Python dependencies. The presence of libraries like `ecdsa`, `base58`, or `bitcoinlib` will be noted.

3.  **Source Code:** The main Python source file(s) will be examined to understand the implementation of the core signing and verification functions.

4.  **Test Suite (`tests/`):** Any test directory will be explored to find clear, working examples of the tool's expected inputs and outputs, which can be invaluable for understanding its practical application.

This initial exploration will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to proceed with a deeper analysis of the tool's functionality.
