# Project Full Potential - Stage 1: GitHub Research Log 02

## Action Taken

This document logs the preparation for the second research step in the study of GitHub. The objective is to locate the canonical documentation portal.

## Execution Plan

The next action is to execute a refined search query using the `google_search` tool.

**Query to be Executed:**
`"GitHub Docs" official`

This query is designed to be more specific than the previous one, increasing the probability of finding the official documentation site as the top result.
