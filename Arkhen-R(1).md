## Abstract

This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the ARKHEN-R (Arkhen-Rigorous) framework, a theoretical approach that proposes information as the fundamental substrate of reality. Based on complementary recent research and scientific developments from 2025, we evaluate the maturity, experimental validation, and future prospects of this ambitious framework. Our analysis reveals that while ARKHEN-R presents significant theoretical contributions—particularly in resolving the entropy paradox in cyclic cosmologies and in the formalization of informational fields—it still faces substantial challenges in experimental validation and integration with the scientific establishment. We discuss recent developments in related areas, including advances in quantum informational field theory, observational evidence for evolving dark energy, and progress in quantum blockchain, contextualizing ARKHEN-R's positioning in the current scientific landscape.

**Keywords:** Informational physics, emergent spacetime, oscillatory cosmology, quantum blockchain, quantum mechanics, experimental validation

## 1. Introduction

The ARKHEN-R framework represents one of the most ambitious and comprehensive proposals for the unification of contemporary theoretical physics. Developed as a rigorous version of the original Arkhen concept, this framework postulates that information constitutes the fundamental substrate from which all physical phenomena emerge, from elementary particles to the large-scale structure of the universe.

Since its initial presentation in 2025, the field of theoretical physics has experienced significant developments that directly impact the feasibility and relevance of ARKHEN-R. Advances in Quantum Information Field Theory (QIFT), observational evidence suggesting the evolution of dark energy, and experimental progress in quantum coherence measurement create a new context for evaluating this framework.

The objective of this article is to provide a critical and updated analysis of the current state of ARKHEN-R, incorporating the most recent scientific developments and identifying the most promising pathways for its validation and evolution.

## 3. State of the Art in Relevant Areas

### 3.1 Quantum Information Field Theory (QIFT)

Recent developments in QIFT (Quantum Information Field Theory) represent both support and a challenge for ARKHEN-R. The pioneering work by Hormachuelos (2025) [1] introduces the concept of **infons**—discrete quanta of relational information—as the fundamental substrate, presenting notable parallels with the informational field Φ of ARKHEN-R.

**Relevant Contributions:**
- Complete mathematical formalization of quantum informational fields
- Demonstration of gravity emergence from infon density
- Prediction of negative-energy stress pockets with potential applications in propulsion

**Challenges for ARKHEN-R:**
- QIFT presents a more detailed and mathematically rigorous formalization
- The discrete infon approach contrasts with ARKHEN-R's continuous field
- QIFT already has specific, testable experimental predictions

### 3.2 Emergent Spacetime

The concept of emergent spacetime, central to ARKHEN-R, received significant experimental support in 2025. Paunkovic et al. (2025) [2] proposed an operational protocol to verify the existence of a spacetime manifold without a priori assuming its existence.

**Significant Advances:**
- Theory-independent experimental protocol for detecting spacetime structure
- Demonstration of the possibility to extract information about dimension and topology
- Establishment of rigorous criteria for the concept of emergence

**Implications for ARKHEN-R:**
- Experimental validation of the emergent spacetime approach
- Need to align the ARKHEN-R framework with these new emergence criteria
- Opportunity to integrate the proposed operational protocols

### 3.3 Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy

Recent results from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) and other cosmological observations suggest that dark energy may not be constant as assumed in the standard ΛCDM model [3,4]. This discovery has profound implications for alternative cosmological models, including ARKHEN-R's oscillatory model.

**Key Discoveries:**
- Statistical evidence for dark energy evolution over time
- Growing incompatibility with the cosmological constant model
- Need for new dynamic cosmological models

**Relevance for ARKHEN-R:**
- The oscillatory model with entropy reset offers an alternative explanation
- Dark energy evolution can be interpreted as transition between oscillatory domains
- Opportunity to test specific framework predictions

### 3.4 Advances in Quantum Blockchain

The field of quantum blockchain experienced substantial progress in 2025, with practical implementations by companies like D-Wave [5,6]. These developments provide important context for evaluating ARKHEN-R's quantum blockchain proposals as multiverse detectors.

**Key Developments:**
- Practical implementation of "Proof of Quantum Work" on quantum computers
- Demonstration of enhanced security compared to classical systems
- Establishment of benchmarks for performance and reliability

**Challenges for ARKHEN-R:**
- Current implementations focus on practical applications, not multiverse detection
- Need to demonstrate the conceptual and experimental feasibility of more ambitious proposals
- Opportunity to integrate practical advances with the framework's theoretical visions

## 4. Critical Analysis of the ARKHEN-R Framework

### 4.1 Significant Contributions

#### 4.1.1 Resolution of the Entropy Paradox

ARKHEN-R's most significant contribution is its innovative approach to resolving the entropy paradox in cyclic cosmologies. The proposed entropy reset mechanism (Theorem 3.6) represents a substantial theoretical advance:

**Positive Aspects:**
- Rigorous mathematical formulation of total entropy conservation
- Introduction of the reset function R(Ω) that mediates conversion between thermal and informational entropy
- Demonstration of the theoretical feasibility of cosmological cycles without violating the second law of thermodynamics

**Comparison with Alternatives:**
Recent developments in thermodynamic horizons in f(Q) gravity [7] and generalized entropy models [8] offer complementary approaches, but ARKHEN-R stands out for its integration with informational theory.

#### 4.1.2 Mathematical Formalization

The framework presents a coherent and comprehensive mathematical structure:

**Strong Elements:**
- Precise definitions of informational field, information density, and coherence function
- Clear axiomatization with three fundamental axioms
- Demonstrated theorems of existence, uniqueness, and stability

**Areas of Excellence:**
- The reduction to established theories (electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) is mathematically sound
- Existence proofs for field equations are constructive
- The formalization of physical emergence from informational criticality is elegant

### 4.2 Limitations and Challenges

#### 4.2.1 Gaps in Formalization

Despite advances, the framework still presents significant gaps:

**Identified Problems:**
- The operational definition of "energy density" in the informational context remains ambiguous
- The transition between quantum and classical regimes needs greater mathematical detail
- The connection with established gauge theories requires additional development

**Comparison with QIFT:**
Hormachuelos' QIFT [1] presents a more complete and mathematically sophisticated formalization, particularly in describing the discrete structure of the informational substrate.

#### 4.2.2 Experimental Challenges

ARKHEN-R's experimental predictions face significant obstacles:

**Prediction 4.1 (Coherence-Energy Relationship):**
- Although theoretically sound, the proposed logarithmic relationship lacks deeper physical justification
- The definition of coherence parameter C in quantum networks presents practical experimental challenges
- The distinction between ARKHEN-R effects and conventional quantum phenomena is unclear

**Prediction 4.2 (Entropic Oscillations):**
- The 10-billion-year timescale makes direct verification impossible
- Proposed indirect signatures in large-scale structure are subtle and difficult to distinguish from conventional effects
- Lack of detailed modeling of specific observables

**Prediction 4.3 (CMB Signatures):**
- The prediction of anomalies at l ≈ 2000 is vague regarding the specific form of signatures
- Secondary CMB effects (lensing, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) may mask subtle signals
- Need for more detailed modeling of the connection between interdimensional interfaces and anisotropies
