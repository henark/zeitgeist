# Task: Optimize TimeChain.sol for Gas Efficiency

Analyze the `TimeChain.sol` smart contract and apply gas optimization techniques to reduce its deployment and runtime costs.

Focus on the following areas:
-   State variable packing
-   Using calldata for read-only dynamic types in external functions
-   Optimizing loops (if any)
-   Using unchecked arithmetic where safe (e.g., in loops with known bounds)

Provide the optimized code in a patch file.

## Context: TimeChain.sol
## Output: patches/001_gas_optimization.patch
