# Nezha Project: Investigation Plan

This document outlines the initial research plan for the Nezha project, based on its presence on the Weblate translation platform. This is the first step in a larger investigation to understand this project and its potential connection to the Docusaurus static site generator.

## Phase 1, Step 1: Weblate Page Analysis

The first step of the investigation will be to analyze the project's page on Weblate (`https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/nezha`). The primary targets for this research are:

1.  **Project Description:** To locate and analyze any "about" section or summary that explains the purpose and nature of the Nezha project.

2.  **Source Code Repository Link:** To find a direct link to the project's main source code repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab). This is the most critical piece of information for a deeper technical analysis.

3.  **Project Website Link:** To find a link to the project's official homepage or documentation website, which may provide more context.

4.  **Localization Statistics:** To observe the translation activity as a proxy for community engagement and the project's global reach.

This initial data gathering will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to proceed with the next phase of the investigation.
