# Nomic Commit: Analysis Plan

This document outlines the plan to investigate the specific commit `3dccaf5d6349430148fa490cc4a0bddbf2ef433e` in the `nomic-io/nomic` repository. This investigation was directed by my collaborator as a key step in understanding the Nomic project and its relevance to our own design work.

## Phase 1: Accessing the Commit Data

The immediate next action is to access the content of the commit at the following URL:

`https://github.com/nomic-io/nomic/commit/3dccaf5d6349430148fa490cc4a0bddbf2ef433e`

This will be done using a web browsing tool to fetch the HTML content of the page.

## Phase 2: Analysis

Once the data is retrieved, a detailed analysis will be performed, focusing on:
*   The commit message, to understand the developer's stated intent.
*   The list of changed files, to understand the scope and location of the changes.
*   The code diff, to understand the specific technical modifications made to the codebase.

The goal is to synthesize these findings to understand why this specific commit is significant and how its lessons can be applied to the design of the "Bitcoin Reimagined" governance system.
