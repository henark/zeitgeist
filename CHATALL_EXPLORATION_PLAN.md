# ChatALL: Exploration Plan

This document outlines the initial exploration plan for the `ChatALL` repository located at `https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL`. This is the first phase of a larger task to study the project and integrate its concepts into our ecosystem.

## Initial Exploration Targets

The first step of the investigation will be to perform a high-level exploration of the repository. The primary targets for this phase are:

1.  **`package.json`:** This file will be analyzed to identify the project's core dependencies, development scripts, and main entry points. This will provide immediate insight into the technology stack (e.g., Electron, React, Vue, etc.) and the libraries used for handling API communications.

2.  **`README.md`:** This is the most critical file for initial understanding. It will be read to learn about the project's official description, its key features, the list of AI models it supports, and the instructions for installation and local development.

3.  **`src` Directory:** The source code directory will be examined to understand the project's structure. The goal is to identify how the code is organized, looking for a separation between frontend (UI) components and backend (API communication) logic.

4.  **`docs` Directory:** Any documentation directory will be explored to find more in-depth information about the project's architecture, contribution guidelines, or future roadmap.

This initial exploration will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to proceed with a deeper analysis of the `ChatALL` architecture and its potential integration into our ecosystem.
