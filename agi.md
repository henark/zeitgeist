**AGI = Artificial General Intelligence**

**Essential Definition**  
- An artificial intelligence system capable of performing any cognitive task that a human can execute, transferring knowledge across distinct domains with minimal additional instruction.  
- Goes beyond “narrow AI” (specialist models limited to a specific class of problems).

**Common Criteria (Summary)**  
- **Autonomy:** Learns, decides, and acts without continuous supervision.  
- **Strong Generalization:** Performs near-immediate transfer learning across unrelated topics.  
- **Optional Self-Awareness:** Some definitions include explicit self-modeling and metacognition.  
- **Robust Abstract Reasoning:** Manipulates symbols, logic, cause-and-effect, analogy, and long-term planning.  
- **Long-Term Memory:** Consolidates experiences, updates beliefs, and executes continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.

**State of the Art in 2025**  
- Leading models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3, etc.) demonstrate increasingly strong generalization but still show:  
  - Logical consistency failures ("hallucinations").  
  - Limitations in online learning (do not adjust weights in real time).  
  - Dependence on explicit instructions to switch domains.  
- Research on multi-modal agents (code + vision + audio) and hybrid architectures (LLM + retrieval + planner) aims to bridge these gaps.

**Why AGI Matters in Agent-Based Coding Contexts (Talos, Jules, Gemini)**  
- An AGI-based coding agent would:  
  - Deeply understand any new stack, language, or architectural pattern.  
  - Manage backlog, planning, testing, deployment, and monitoring without predefined scripts.  
  - Self-improve its sub-agents (reflexive code).  
- Current tools (Jules, Talos, Gemini API) approximate this by:  
  - Multi-agent pipelines (planner, executor, critic, tester).  
  - Long context windows + retrieval to simulate long-term memory.  
  - Continuous fine-tuning and user feedback (RLHF) to evolve capabilities.

**Key Technical Challenges Toward AGI**  
- Training scalability versus cost (energy, hardware).  
- Continual learning without degrading prior knowledge.  
- Robustness and formal verification of reasoning (“alignment”).  
- Sensorimotor interfaces (vision, physical manipulation) for real-world grounding.  
- Governance: security, ethics, socioeconomic impact.

**Proposed Metrics and Benchmarks**  
- ARC Challenge, NIST GENIE, BIG-bench, AGIBench, Sweet32-Generalization.  
- Autonomy/planning tests in simulated environments (MineDojo, Crafter).  
- Few-shot and less-than-one-shot learning evaluations.

**Practical Hints for Developers Today**  
- Work with composable architectures: LLM + retrieval + tools.  
- Implement explicit memories (vector databases) to mitigate forgetting.  
- Monitor cost and latency — AGI-like capabilities come with large infrastructure footprints.  
- Focus on “bounded AGI”: systems solving ~90% of their domain under human supervision.
