# Intuition Systems Explorer: Analysis Template

This document outlines the preliminary analysis and investigation template for the block explorer located at `https://testnet.explorer.intuition.systems`. It is based on the instruction to learn about **tokens, bridges, and addresses** related to the **"wETH = tTRUST"** concept.

## 1. Expected Structure and Features

Based on standard block explorer design, the following features and sections are anticipated:

*   **Homepage/Dashboard:** A summary of the network status, including latest block number, total transactions, and number of addresses. A search bar is expected for direct lookups.
*   **Tokens Section:** A dedicated page listing all tokens on the network. This will be the primary location to search for the "tTRUST" / "wETH" token.
*   **Bridge Interface:** A potential "Bridge" tab with an interface for asset transfers and information on supported networks.
*   **Addresses/Accounts Section:** A list of top accounts or a "rich list" showing the distribution of tokens.

## 2. Targeted Analysis Plan

The investigation will focus on extracting the following specific information:

*   **For Tokens:**
    *   The official contract address for the "tTRUST" / "wETH" token.
    *   The token's total supply.
    *   The number of unique addresses holding the token.
    *   A view of recent transactions involving the token.

*   **For the Bridge:**
    *   Confirmation of the bridge's existence and its user interface.
    *   The other networks it connects to.
    *   The volume of assets transferred through the bridge.

*   **For Addresses:**
    *   The addresses of the top holders of the "tTRUST" token.
    *   Identification of any notable smart contracts or system-level addresses (e.g., treasury, staking contracts).

This template will guide the data extraction from the block explorer once it is accessed.
