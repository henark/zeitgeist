# Bittensor: Conceptual Research Plan

This document outlines the initial research plan for investigating the Bittensor project. This is the first phase of a larger analysis to understand its architecture and synthesize its concepts into our ecosystem of ideas.

## Phase 1, Step 1: In-depth Reading Plan

The first step is a deep dive into the conceptual foundations of Bittensor, using external research tools.

### Research Queue

1.  **Initial Search:** Use a search engine with the query "Bittensor official website" to locate the project's main homepage.
2.  **Homepage Analysis:** Analyze the homepage to find canonical links to the project's whitepaper, official documentation, and a high-level overview of its mission.
3.  **Whitepaper Study:** Perform a detailed analysis of the Bittensor whitepaper to understand:
    *   The core philosophical motivation behind creating a decentralized market for intelligence.
    *   The formal definition and mechanics of the Yuma Consensus mechanism.
    *   The tokenomics of the TAO token, including its issuance, distribution, and role in the incentive structure.
    *   The technical architecture of the subnets and how they enable specialized, competitive AI services.
4.  **Documentation Review:** Browse the official documentation to understand the practical aspects of participating in the network, such as the process for setting up a miner or validator.

This structured research plan will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to proceed with a deeper technical analysis and a comparative synthesis with our own theoretical models.
