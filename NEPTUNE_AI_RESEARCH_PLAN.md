# Neptune.ai: MLOps Research Plan

This document outlines the research plan for the `neptune.ai` platform. This investigation is a key step in designing the 'Coherent Worlds Operating Manual', which will define the MLOps framework for our autonomous game studio.

## Phase 1: Platform Study

The first step is a deep dive into the `neptune.ai` platform to understand its core features and principles.

### Research Targets

The investigation of the website (`https://neptune.ai`) will focus on extracting the following information:

1.  **Core MLOps Features:**
    *   **Experiment Tracking:** How does the platform log experiments, including parameters, code versions, and results?
    *   **Model Registry:** What are the mechanisms for versioning, staging (e.g., development, production), and managing the lifecycle of machine learning models?
    *   **Monitoring and Visualization:** What types of dashboards and tools are provided for monitoring model performance in real-time?

2.  **Integration and API:**
    *   An analysis of the official documentation to understand the Neptune API and how it integrates with common ML frameworks and development workflows.

3.  **Real-World Use Cases:**
    *   A review of any available case studies or customer stories to see how the platform is used to solve practical MLOps challenges.

This research will provide the foundational knowledge required to design a robust and professional operational framework for the 'Coherent Worlds' studio.
