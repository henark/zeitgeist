# Aurumgrid: Project Genesis Plan

## Preamble

This document marks the true beginning of the Aurumgrid project. It is a response to the "Critical Limitations" identified in the project's conceptual stage, and it outlines a grounded, realistic, and professional plan to move from vision to reality.

## The Core Challenge

The Aurumgrid project currently exists as a powerful vision but lacks:
1.  A public-facing technical whitepaper.
2.  Functional, executable code.
3.  Empirical validation and reproducible experiments.
4.  Verifiable assets.

## The Genesis Plan

The following four-phase plan will address these limitations and begin the process of building Aurumgrid from the ground up.

### 1. Create the Public Whitepaper
The first and most critical task is to create the official **Aurumgrid Whitepaper**. This document will synthesize all of our conceptual work—from the `Z(n)` framework to the `Coherent Futarchy` module—into a single, comprehensive technical and philosophical specification. This will serve as the project's public foundation.

### 2. Build the First Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
After the whitepaper is drafted, work will begin on a PoC for the simplest core component: the **`chrono-bridge.wasm`** module. This will be the first piece of working, verifiable code in the ecosystem.

### 3. Design the First Experiment
The PoC will be accompanied by a **minimal, reproducible experiment**. This will involve creating a synthetic dataset and a test suite to demonstrate and validate the function of the `chrono-bridge`.

### 4. A Commitment to Verifiability
All artifacts produced from this point forward—the whitepaper, the code, the experiments—will be created with maximum clarity, rigor, and transparency. **Verifiability** will be a core design principle of all work done by the 'Coherent Worlds' studio.

The work begins now.
