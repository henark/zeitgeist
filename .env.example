# --- BOT BEHAVIOR ---
# Set to "true" to automatically complete tasks
AUTO_TASKS="true"

# Set to "true" to automatically claim referral bonuses
AUTO_CLAIM_REFF="true"

# Set to "true" to automatically upgrade when possible
AUTO_UPGRADE="true"


# --- TIME CALIBRATION ---
# The two main time cycles for the bot.

# The minor cycle: how often (in seconds) the bot should run its claim/upgrade loop.
# The game's farming duration is typically several hours, so a value like 3600 (1 hour) is reasonable.
REFRESH_CLAIM="3600"

# The major cycle: how often (in seconds) the bot should get new authentication tokens.
# This should be less than the token expiry time. A safe value might be 86400 (24 hours).
REFRESH_TOKEN="86400"
