# GridWalker Project: Investigation Plan

This document outlines the initial research plan for the `GridWalker` project, based on its page on the Python Package Index (PyPI). This investigation is part of the "First Operational Test" of the SPE architecture, and `GridWalker` will be evaluated as a potential tool for modeling and visualization.

## Phase 1, Step 1: PyPI Page Analysis

The first step of the investigation will be to analyze the project's page on PyPI (`https://pypi.org/project/GridWalker`). The primary targets for this research are:

1.  **Project Description:** To analyze the main summary to understand the library's purpose and to validate the hypothesis that it is a tool for grid-based environments (e.g., for agent-based modeling or reinforcement learning).

2.  **Project Links:** To locate the critical links to the project's homepage, its full documentation, and its source code repository. These links are necessary for any deeper technical analysis.

3.  **Dependencies and Version Information:** To review the library's dependencies and current version to understand its technical requirements and maturity.

This initial data gathering will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to evaluate `GridWalker`'s suitability for our experiment.
