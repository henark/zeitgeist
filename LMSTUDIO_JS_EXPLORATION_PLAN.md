# LM-Studio-JS: Exploration Plan

This document outlines the initial exploration plan for the `lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-js` repository. This is the first step in a larger investigation to understand this library and its potential connection to the `arcnetwork.xyz` project.

## Phase 1, Step 1: Repository Exploration Targets

The first step of the investigation will be a high-level exploration of the repository to understand its structure, technology stack, and core purpose. The primary targets for this phase are:

1.  **`package.json`:** This file will be analyzed to identify the project's core dependencies (e.g., HTTP clients like `axios` or `node-fetch`), its main entry point, and any scripts for building, testing, or development.

2.  **`README.md`:** This is the most critical file for initial understanding. It will be read to learn about the project's official description, its features, its API documentation, and to find usage examples.

3.  **Source Code (`src`/`lib`):** The source code directory will be examined to understand the project's architecture. The goal is to identify the classes and functions that map to the LM Studio local inference server's API, such as methods for loading models, managing chat sessions, and generating completions.

4.  **Examples (`examples` directory):** Any example directory will be explored to find practical, working code that demonstrates how to integrate and use the `lmstudio-js` library in a real-world application.

This initial exploration will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to proceed with a deeper analysis of the library's functionality.
