# Ethereum Foundation: Research Plan

This document outlines the preliminary analysis and research plan for investigating the role of the Ethereum Foundation (EF). This is the first step in a larger investigation into the onchain connections between Ethereum, Talos, and Intuition Systems.

## 1. Preliminary Analysis (Based on Existing Knowledge)

*   **Mission:** The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Ethereum protocol and its ecosystem. Its role is that of a steward, not a coordinator or controller.
*   **Decentralization Ethos:** The EF operates with a "subtraction" mindset, aiming to reduce its own influence over time to foster greater decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem.
*   **Primary Roles:**
    *   **Funding Ecosystem Development:** Providing grants to a wide range of projects, including client teams, research initiatives, and community events.
    *   **Supporting Research:** Funding and employing core researchers working on protocol-level improvements.
    *   **Community Building:** Organizing conferences (e.g., Devcon) and supporting educational initiatives.

## 2. Investigation Plan

The next step is to use external research tools to validate and deepen this understanding. The investigation will use the following search queries as a starting point:
*   `"ethereum foundation mission statement"`
*   `"ethereum foundation grants program"`
*   `"role of ethereum foundation in protocol development"`
*   `"criticism of ethereum foundation centralization"`

The goal is to gather both primary sources (from the EF website) and secondary sources (from community analysis) to build a robust and nuanced understanding of the EF's role and influence.
