# Λ‑Archaeology: Formal Preliminaries and Axioms

This document contains the formal theoretical core for the paper on Λ‑Archaeology. It is based on the scaffold provided by my collaborator.

## 4. Formal Preliminaries

### 4.1 Notation and Basic Structures
We work over a finite alphabet Σ (e.g., Σ={0,1} for binary data or a set of artifact types for archaeology).
For a set X we write |X| for its cardinality, 2^X for its power set, and P(X) for the set of probability distributions on X.
Given random variables X,Y we denote by H(X) the Shannon entropy and by I(X;Y) their mutual information.

All transformations are modeled as (partial) functions T: X -> Y; when randomness is involved we treat T as a stochastic kernel T(y|x).

### 4.2 Stratigraphic Model
An archaeological site is formalized as a tuple `S = (L, ⪯, A, φ)` where:
- `L` is a finite set of *layers*;
- `⪯` is a partial order on `L` representing stratigraphic superposition (i.e., l_i ⪯ l_j means l_i lies below l_j);
- `A` is the set of *artifacts*;
- `φ: A -> L` assigns each artifact to the layer in which it was found.

The *site state* is the hidden vector x ∈ Σ^A encoding the original cultural information (function, typology, usage) of each artifact.

### 4.3 Cryptographic Model
A classical substitution cipher is captured by a bijection `κ: Σ* -> Σ*` where Σ* denotes all finite strings over Σ. In a more general setting we allow a stochastic encryption channel E: Σ* -> Σ* with transition probabilities E(c|m).

### 4.4 Common Inference Problem
Both domains share the following generic recovery problem:

**Definition (Inference Problem):** Given an observed datum y ∈ Y generated by `y = T(x) ⊕ η`, where T: X -> Y is a transformation (deterministic or stochastic) and η is a noise term (possibly null), the task is to infer the hidden source x.

In archaeology T = φ (the stratigraphic projection) and η models post-depositional disturbance; in cryptography T = κ (or E) and η captures transmission errors or deliberate padding.

## 5. Λ‑Archaeology Axioms

### 5.1 Motivation
The isomorphism claimed in the introduction rests on the observation that both a stratigraphic site `S` and a cipher `C` instantiate the same abstract algebraic structure. To make this claim rigorous we introduce the **Λ‑Algebra**, a small set of axioms that any admissible transformation T must satisfy. From these axioms we derive the existence of a universal decoder operator Δ (the Λ‑decoder) that works across both domains.

### 5.2 Axiom 1 – Closure under Transformation
**Axiom (Closure):** For any admissible source x∈X and any admissible transformation T, the pair (T,x) yields a well-defined observation y ∈ Y.
*Intuition:* Both stratigraphic projection and encryption are total (or at least almost everywhere defined) mappings from the hidden state space to the observable space.

### 5.3 Axiom 2 – Existence of a Projection Functor
**Axiom (Projection Functor):** There exists a functor Π: **Strat** -> **Crypt** (and its inverse Π⁻¹) such that for every stratigraphic transformation T_arch there is a corresponding cryptographic transformation T_crypt = Π(T_arch) preserving the compositional structure.
*Intuition:* This formalizes the core analogy between the two domains.

### 5.4 Axiom 3 – Information Preservation (Bounded Loss)
**Axiom (Bounded Information Loss):** For every admissible T and source distribution p_X, the mutual information satisfies `I(X;Y) ≥ I(X; Δ(Y)) - ε`, for some constant ε ≥ 0 that depends only on the noise model η.
*Interpretation:* Neither stratigraphic mixing nor encryption can increase information about the hidden source beyond what is already present in the observation; the decoder Δ can recover at most a fraction 1-ε of that information.

### 5.5 Axiom 4 – Compositionality
**Axiom (Compositionality):** Given two admissible transformations T₁: X->Y and T₂: Y->Z, their composition T₂∘T₁ is also admissible, and `Δ_{T₂∘T₁} = Δ_{T₁}∘Δ_{T₂}`.
*Intuition:* This axiom endows the set of transformations with a monoid structure, which is crucial for building multi-stage decoders.

### 5.6 Axiom 5 – Existence of a Decoding Operator
**Axiom (Decoding Operator):** For every admissible transformation T there exists a (possibly stochastic) operator Δ_T: Y -> X such that `Δ_T(T(x)) = x` with probability 1-δ, where δ is bounded above by a function of the noise level.
*Intuition:* This guarantees that recovery is possible in principle. The operator Δ_T is what we later instantiate as the **Λ‑decoder**.

### 5.7 Immediate Consequences
**Corollary (Universal Decoding):** Under Axioms 1–5, the mapping `Δ = ⋃_{T∈Τ} Δ_T` is well defined and domain-agnostic. Consequently, a single learning architecture can be trained to approximate Δ for any T drawn from the admissible family Τ.

### 5.8 Example Instantiations
**Archaeology:**
- X = vector of original artifact functions ∈ Σ^A.
- T_arch = φ (layer projection).
- η = post-depositional disturbance (soil mixing, erosion).
- Δ_φ = algorithm that re-assembles artifacts into their original functional categories.

**Cryptography:**
- X = plaintext message m ∈ Σ*.
- T_crypt = κ (substitution cipher) or E (stochastic encryption).
- η = transmission noise or padding.
- Δ_κ = classic de-substitution algorithm (or neural cryptanalysis model).

Both satisfy the axioms, confirming the isomorphism.
