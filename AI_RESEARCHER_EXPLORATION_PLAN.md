# AI-Researcher: Exploration Plan

This document outlines the plan for exploring and understanding the `AI-Researcher` project located at `https://github.com/HKUDS/AI-Researcher`.

## Phase 1: Initial Exploration and Scoping

The immediate goal is to understand the project's layout, dependencies, and fundamental purpose. The investigation will focus on identifying the following key files and directories:

*   **`README.md`:** To get a high-level overview of the project, its features, and setup instructions.
*   **Dependency Files:** To identify the technology stack (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python, `package.json` for Node.js).
*   **Source Code Directory:** To locate the main source code (e.g., a `src` or `ai_researcher` directory).
*   **Documentation and Examples:** To find any `docs` or `examples` directories that illustrate usage and architecture.

This initial phase will provide the necessary context to perform a deeper analysis of the codebase.
