# Talos Integration Strategy: Document Review

This document contains the initial review of existing documents related to the Talos framework, as part of formulating a new integration strategy.

## 1. `analise_estrategica.md` (as revised)

This document now serves as a Talos Improvement Proposal (TIP). Its key contributions to the integration strategy are:
*   It establishes a clear strategic distinction between using **Google Jules** (a high-level, predictable-cost agent) for asynchronous tasks and the **Gemini Pro API** (a low-level, granular-control model) for custom agent logic.
*   It provides a quick-start guide for both tools, laying the practical groundwork for integration.

## 2. `talos` (the feedback file)

This file contained the critical feedback for improving the TIP. The key requirements and considerations for the integration strategy derived from this file are:
*   **Practical Integration:** The strategy must define how a closed system like Jules can connect to an open-source framework like Talos. Potential methods to explore are Webhooks, a dedicated CLI bridge, or a plugin-based architecture.
*   **Licensing:** The strategy must clarify the implications of using a SaaS product (Jules) within an Apache-2.0 licensed project (Talos).
*   **Composability:** The integration must align with the core Talos principle of composing small, specialized agents.

This review consolidates the foundational knowledge required to draft the new integration strategy document.
