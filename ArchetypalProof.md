# The Materialization of Archetypal Patterns in Information Science and Quantum Computing (2025)

## Abstract

This article presents an academic, rigorous, and transdisciplinary version of an interpretive thesis on the convergence of **modular quantum computing**, **distributed informational infrastructures** (e.g., blockchain), and **additive manufacturing** (3D printing). We analyze recent technical developments — especially IBM’s roadmap for **quantum-centric supercomputing** and Microsoft’s announcement of the **Majorana 1** (topological QPU) — as technoscientific evidence that lends plausibility to a theoretical framework based on three principles: (i) the **triadic structure** (physical–informational–quantum); (ii) **verifiable modularity**; (iii) **distributed informational encapsulation**. From a methodology of **archetypal synthesis** (abduction structured through cross-domain analogies), we propose testable propositions concerning (A) reality as a distributed informational system, (B) consciousness as a consensus process with analogies to informational redundancy (quantum Darwinism), and (C) evolution as the progressive “printing” of complexity. We discuss limitations, risks of extrapolation, and empirical agendas for falsification/collaboration.

**Keywords:** modular quantum computing; topological qubits; distributed consensus; blockchain; additive manufacturing; quantum Darwinism; philosophy of information.

## 1. Introduction

Recent years have seen a concrete inflection toward **large-scale quantum–classical integration**. On February 19, 2025, Microsoft announced the **Majorana 1**, described as the first **quantum processing unit (QPU) with topological qubits** based on a “**topological superconductor**” and a **Topological Core architecture**, with the explicit ambition of shortening the horizon for **fault tolerance** “from decades to years.”  On June 10, 2025, IBM outlined its plan to build the **world’s first large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer** at a new dedicated data center, articulating this effort with its vision of **quantum-centric supercomputing**: a fabric that **weaves QPUs, CPUs, and GPUs** into a coherent computational mesh.

Taken as **sentinel cases**, these initiatives reinforce the hypothesis that certain **archetypal patterns** — modularity, encapsulation, and distributed verification — traverse distinct ontological levels and **recur** in next-generation technologies.

## 2. Recent technical-scientific foundations

### 2.1. Quantum-centric supercomputing (IBM)

Since 2022, IBM has formalized the concept of **quantum-centric supercomputing**, i.e., architectures that **couple** QPUs to **HPC systems** through dedicated software, interconnections, and schedulers. This vision was updated in 2025 with goals for **modular scaling**, error-correcting codes (e.g., *bivariate bicycle*), and a trajectory toward **useful logical machines**, culminating in the **Starling system** projected for 2029 (capable of executing \~**100 million gates** on **\~200 logical qubits**).  The company also announced a **quantum data center** and a path toward **large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers**.

### 2.2. Topological qubits and the Majorana 1 (Microsoft)

Microsoft presented the **Majorana 1** as a QPU in which **processing and memory** are integrated into a **topological core** built on a **topological superconductor**, leveraging **Majorana modes** for **intrinsic noise protection**. The company links this advance to an acceleration of **fault tolerance** and an **engineering ramp** (e.g., via DARPA consortia) to expand qubit density and fidelity.  Academic evidence of relevant *building blocks* (interferometry, *parity readout*, and InAs-Al heterostructures) was reported in *Nature* in 2025, reinforcing the physical plausibility of scalable topological devices.

## 3. Theoretical framework: three archetypal principles

**(P1) Triadic structure (physical–informational–quantum).**

* **Physical:** **Additive manufacturing** materializes forms by **discrete layers**, as per ISO/ASTM 52900 standards and consolidated literature.
* **Informational:** **Blockchains** organize data into **chained blocks** with **distributed consensus**, ensuring conditional immutability and broad verifiability.
* **Quantum:** the **substrate** of states and entanglement provides degrees of freedom for computation and metrology, but requires **protection/error-correction** modularity.

**(P2) Principle of verifiable modularity.**
Modern engineering favors **self-certifying modules**: **logical qubits** composed of many physical ones; **shards/sub-ledgers** that are auditable; **manufactured parts** validated by testing. IBM and Microsoft’s roadmaps explicitly point toward **quantum modules** with **standardized interfaces** and **parallel composition** (running subroutines and “stitching” results), aligned with proposals for **distributed quantum computing** via interconnections and entanglement.

**(P3) Distributed informational encapsulation.**
The redundancy/replication of **informational records** confers **operational objectivity**: at the microphysical limit, **quantum Darwinism** conceptualizes how **environments** proliferate **redundant copies** (*environment as a witness*), enabling agreement among observers on **pointer states**.

## 4. Methodology: archetypal synthesis (structured abduction)

We employ an **abductive strategy** in three steps: (i) mapping **isomorphisms of structure** (layers/blocks/logical qubits); (ii) **triangulation** with recent technical-scientific sources (roadmaps, white papers, peer-reviewed articles); (iii) formulation of **refutable propositions**. The approach is **theoretical-constructive** (not empirical) but oriented toward **observables** that can support validation/falsification.

## 5. Propositions and dialogue with the literature

### 5.1. Reality as a distributed informational system

**Thesis:** the empirical regularity of mechanisms of **encapsulation + consensus + redundancy** across scales suggests an informational ontology compatible with **Wheeler’s** (*it from bit*) and **Floridi’s Philosophy of Information**.
**Implication:** laws and causality may be interpreted as **consistency rules** over distributed records (ledger analogy). **Caution:** this is a **heuristic metaphor**, not a literal identification (*cosmic blockchain*).

### 5.2. Consciousness as consensus (informational analogy)

**Hypothesis:** conscious processes could exploit **redundancies** and **internal consensus** among neural modules, analogous to **quantum Darwinism** (environmental redundancy of records).
**Counterpoint:** classical critiques (e.g., **Tegmark**, 2000) estimate **brain decoherence times** as too short for macroscopic coherent quantum computation; proposals such as **Orch-OR** remain controversial.  Thus, the analogy here is **informational-structural**, not a claim of **strong quantum cognition**.

### 5.3. Evolution as progressive “printing” of complexity

**Programmatic hypothesis:** biological evolution may be read as the **layer-by-layer accretion** of **functional structures**, with **distributed verification** through environments and ecologies (analogous to incremental printing). This proposition seeks dialogue with **systems biology** and **materials informatics**; its testability depends on **metrics of redundancy/consensus** in biophysical networks. (Not a claim that “DNA is literally a blockchain.”)

## 6. Technological implications (scenarios)

1. **Modular informational medicine (2025–2027).**
   **Immediate and plausible use:** quantum–classical simulations (**quantum-centric**) for **drug chemistry/optimization**, with **validation** via standardized pipelines and **auditable trails** (DAGs, scientific ledgers). Recent technical evidence (IBM) provides **backing** for high-performance hybrid workflows.

2. **Adaptive materials (2027–2030).**
   Integration of **materials discovery** via information/consensus models (autonomous labs) with **additive manufacturing** to **iterate geometries and microstructures** rapidly, combining measurement, feedback, and layered production.

3. **Programmable reality (2030–2035).**
   Speculative (high risk): quantum–classical stacks with **interoperable modules** and **protective codes** could enable **local control** of **effective dynamics** (e.g., engineered Hamiltonians), but **not** manipulation of **fundamental constants**; this remains a **hypothetical perspective** dependent on matured **topological error-correction logics**.

## 7. Limitations, risks, and criteria for refutation

* **Evolving technical evidence:** the 2025 announcements (IBM/Microsoft) outline **roadmaps and prototypes**, not ready-made commodities. The claim of “years, not decades” for **FTQC** is an **engineering wager**; objective milestones include **logical qubits with sustained fidelity/lifetime** and **deep circuits** of practical use.
* **Analogy ≠ identity:** “blockchain,” “3D printing,” and “quantum consensus” are **structural metaphors**. They must be operationalized into **predictions**: e.g., (i) demonstrations of **linked quantum modules** via **entanglement swapping** with total ***error rates*** below thresholds; (ii) **redundancy metrics** à la **quantum Darwinism** in **physical systems** (not mental) that explain intersubjective objectivity; (iii) **auditable workflows** of scientific data/models with **reproducible provenance**.
* **Consciousness:** any “strong quantum” links to the brain remain **controversial**; critiques of **fast decoherence** remain substantive.

## 8. Conclusion

The **modular quantum–classical convergence** (e.g., IBM) and the advance in **topological qubits** (e.g., Microsoft Majorana 1) provide **empirical substance** to an archetypal reading in which **modularity**, **encapsulation**, and **consensus/validation** recur across multiple layers of organization. This framework **does not imply** reducing the world to a literal blockchain; rather, it proposes **structural heuristics** that may **guide research**, **standardization**, and **science policy**. The suggested program is **refutable**: either we will see **interoperable and useful quantum modules** with functional **error correction** and **end-to-end verifiable workflows**, or the archetypal thesis will lose explanatory power. For now, the milestones of 2025 legitimize **serious attention** to the hypothesis.
