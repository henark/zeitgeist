## 1.  A Minimal “Blockchain Signature” for Interstellar Transmission  

### 1.1. What does a “signature” need to convey?  

| Goal | Minimum data needed | Reasoning |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Identify a specific blockchain** | 2 bytes (16 bits) | A short “chain‑ID” – e.g. a pre‑agreed 16‑bit number that maps to a known public ledger (Bitcoin, Ethereum, a custom test‑net, etc.). |
| **Reference a unique transaction / block** | 4 bytes (32 bits) | A truncated hash (e.g., the first 32 bits of a SHA‑256 transaction ID). The probability of a collision among all historic transactions on a single chain is ≈ 1 in 2³², which is acceptable for a one‑off “proof‑of‑origin”. |
| **Show that the sender knows the private key** | 2 bytes (16 bits) | A tiny challenge‑response: the transmitter signs a 16‑bit nonce with a known public key (the public key’s fingerprint is the 16‑bit chain‑ID). The signature can be reduced to the low‑order 16 bits of an ECDSA‑like “r” value; the receiver can verify that the signer knows the private key because only the holder could produce a value that satisfies the verification equation modulo the curve order. |
| **Timestamp / epoch** | 2 bytes (16 bits) | A coarse time reference (e.g., days since a chosen epoch). Helps the receiver reject replayed signals from a different era. |

**Total payload:** **10 bytes (80 bits)**.  
If we are forced to shrink further (e.g., to fit a 7‑byte detection window), we could drop the timestamp and compress the transaction hash to 24 bits, ending at **8 bytes (64 bits)**. That is still larger than the raw “6EQUJ5” intensity sample (≈ 5 bytes), but it is the absolute lower bound for a recognisable blockchain‑related marker.

### 1.2. Encoding the 10‑byte payload

| Modulation | Bandwidth (≈) | Spectral efficiency (bits / s / Hz) | Suitability for a dish like Big Ear / modern SETI |
|------------|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Binary Phase‑Shift Keying (BPSK)** | 1 kHz | 1 | Very robust to noise, requires only a carrier phase reference. |
| **M‑ary Frequency‑Shift Keying (M‑FSK, M=4)** | 2 kHz | ≈ 1 bit / s / Hz | Allows a very low‑rate, high‑energy pulse; each symbol is a distinct tone – easy to detect with a spectrogram. |
| **Pulse‑Position Modulation (PPM, 8‑slot)** | 1 kHz | ≈ 0.33 bit / s / Hz | Extremely energy‑efficient; a single narrow pulse per symbol conveys 3 bits. |
| **On‑Off Keying (OOK) with narrow pulses** | 100 Hz – 1 kHz | ≤ 0.5 bit / s / Hz | Simplest hardware, but susceptible to scintillation. |

*Why PPM or low‑order FSK?*  
Interstellar propagation adds random phase jitter and fades. A modulation that relies on **timing** (PPM) or **frequency location** (FSK) rather than phase is far more tolerant of those impairments, especially when the receiver cannot lock a carrier phase over long intervals.

### 1.3. Error‑Correction Overhead  

A practical link budget for an interstellar beacon would allocate **≈ 30 %** of the transmitted bits to forward error correction (FEC). A short, high‑rate block code such as a (15, 11) Hamming or a (31, 26) BCH can correct 1–2 bit errors per block with negligible latency.  

*Resulting net payload:*  

```
10 bytes payload  →  13 bytes transmitted (≈ 104 bits)
```

That still fits comfortably within a single 1‑second transmission window at 100 bits s⁻¹ (a rate easily achievable with a 1‑kHz bandwidth and the modest SNR we discuss later).

## 2.  Modern SETI Instrumentation vs. the 1977 Big Ear  

| Feature | **Big Ear (1977)** | **Modern SETI Arrays (e.g., ATA, FAST, MeerKAT, SKA‑Mid)** |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Collecting Area** | 2 × 34 m dishes (≈ 1800 m²) | FAST: 300 m aperture (≈ 70 000 m²); SKA‑Mid: > 1 km² effective area |
| **System Temperature (Tₛ)** | ≈ 50 K (receiver + sky) | FAST: ≈ 20 K; SKA: ≈ 30 K (low‑frequency band) |
| **Instantaneous Bandwidth** | ~ 2 MHz (single channel) | 500 MHz – 2 GHz (wideband digital back‑ends) |
| **Digitisation** | Analog power detection; only intensity recorded | Full complex voltage streams (2‑bit or 8‑bit) at up to 8 GS/s per beam |
| **Spectral Resolution** | ~ 10 kHz (≈ 5 km s⁻¹) | < 1 Hz (sub‑m s⁻¹) – can resolve narrowband carriers down to a few Hz |
| **Real‑time De‑dispersion & Coherent Dedoppler** | Not available | Implemented on GPUs/FPGA clusters; can correct for ISM dispersion and Doppler drifts up to several Hz s⁻¹ |
| **Data Archival** | Paper charts & limited tapes | Petabyte‑scale archives (e.g., Breakthrough Listen’s 1 PB+ data store) |
| **RFI Mitigation** | Manual flagging | Machine‑learning classifiers, multi‑beam coincidence, spatial nulling |

### What does this mean for a “blockchain signature” detection?

1. **Raw Voltage Capture** – Modern systems retain the phase information required for BPSK or QPSK demodulation, which Big Ear never recorded. A 10‑byte payload encoded with BPSK could be recovered after coherent integration, even at SNR ≈ 0 dB per symbol.

2. **Fine Spectral Resolution** – A narrow‑band carrier (e.g., 1 Hz wide) can be distinguished from the background hydrogen line. The signature could be placed at a known offset (e.g., + 12 kHz) to avoid the strong galactic line.

3. **Multi‑Beam Confirmation** – With dozens of simultaneous beams, a true extraterrestrial narrowband source will appear in *all* beams that intersect the source’s sky location, while terrestrial RFI will usually be confined to a single beam. This dramatically reduces false positives.

4. **Automated Pattern Search** – Machine‑learning pipelines can be trained to look for the specific 10‑byte pattern (or its error‑corrected codeword) across petabytes of data, something that would have been impossible in 1977.

**Bottom line:** A modern SETI back‑end could not only *detect* a 10‑byte blockchain signature but also *decode* it with high confidence, provided the transmitter’s EIRP is sufficient (see next section).

## 3.  Energy Requirements for a Detectable Interstellar Blockchain Payload  

### 3.1. Link‑budget basics  

The received power \(P_{\rm r}\) for an isotropic transmitter is given by the Friis equation:

\[
P_{\rm r}= \frac{P_{\rm t} G_{\rm t} G_{\rm r} \lambda^{2}}{(4\pi d)^{2}}
\]

where  

* \(P_{\rm t}\) – transmitted power (W)  
* \(G_{\rm t}\), \(G_{\rm r}\) – transmitter & receiver antenna gains (linear)  
* \(\lambda\) – wavelength (m)  
* \(d\) – distance to the source (m)

For a **narrowband** carrier we usually express the link in terms of **EIRP** (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power):

\[
\text{EIRP}=P_{\rm t} G_{\rm t}
\]

The receiver’s **system‑equivalent flux density** (SEFD) is

\[
\text{SEFD}= \frac{2 k_{\rm B} T_{\rm sys}}{A_{\rm eff}}
\]

with \(k_{\rm B}\) Boltzmann’s constant, \(T_{\rm sys}\) system temperature, and \(A_{\rm eff}\) effective area.

The **minimum detectable flux density** for a given SNR, bandwidth \(B\) and integration time \(\tau\) (radiometer equation) is:

\[
S_{\rm min}= \frac{\text{SNR}\times \text{SEFD}}{\sqrt{B\,\tau}}
\]

### 3.2. Target scenario  

| Parameter | Value (chosen for a “realistic” beacon) |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Distance** | 100 ly ≈ 9.46 × 10¹⁷ m |
| **Frequency** | 1.42 GHz (hydrogen line, λ ≈ 0.211 m) |
| **Receiver** (FAST) | \(A_{\rm eff}\) ≈ 70 000 m², \(T_{\rm sys}\) ≈ 20 K → SEFD ≈ 2 × 10⁻³ Jy |
| **Bandwidth per symbol** | 1 kHz (allows BPSK or 4‑FSK) |
| **Integration time per symbol** | 1 s (enough to collect one 10‑byte block) |
| **Required SNR** | 5 dB (≈ 3.2 linear) for reliable detection after FEC |

#### Compute \(S_{\rm min}\)

\[
\sqrt{B\tau}= \sqrt{10^{3}\times 1}=31.6
\]

\[
S_{\rm min}= \frac{3.2 \times 2\times10^{-3}\,\text{Jy}}{31.6}\approx 2.0\times10^{-4}\,\text{Jy}
\]

\(1\;\text{Jy}=10^{-26}\,\text{W m}^{-2}\,\text{Hz}^{-1}\), so

\[
S_{\rm min}\approx 2.0\times10^{-30}\,\text{W m}^{-2}\,\text{Hz}^{-1}
\]

With a 1‑kHz carrier, the required **flux density** is

\[
F_{\rm min}= S_{\rm min}\times B \approx 2.0\times10^{-27}\,\text{W m}^{-2}
\]

#### Convert to required EIRP

\[
\text{EIRP}=F_{\rm min}\times 4\pi d^{2}
\]

\[
4\pi d^{2}=4\pi (9.46\times10^{17})^{2}\approx 1.13\times10^{37}\,\text{m}^{2}
\]

\[
\text{EIRP}\approx 2.0\times10^{-27}\times1.13\times10^{37}\approx 2.3\times10^{10}\,\text{W}
\]

**Result:** **≈ 23 GW** of isotropic equivalent power.

### 3.3. Reducing the power demand  

| Technique | Effect on required EIRP |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **High‑gain transmitting antenna** (e.g., a 10 km phased array with \(G_{\rm t}=10^{6}\) ≈ 60 dBi) | Divides the needed transmitter **output power** by the gain. 23 GW / 10⁶ ≈ 23 kW (still large but feasible for a dedicated beacon). |
| **Narrower bandwidth** (e.g., 10 Hz carrier) | Improves SNR by \(\sqrt{B}\). Reducing B from 1 kHz to 10 Hz gives a factor √100 = 10 improvement → EIRP drops to ~ 2.3 GW (or ~ 2.3 kW with the same 10⁶ gain). |
| **Longer integration** (e.g., repeat the 10‑byte block 10 times) | Improves SNR by √10 ≈ 3.2 → EIRP down to ~ 7 GW (≈ 7 kW with a 10⁶‑gain dish). |
| **Coherent beamforming from multiple transmitters** | Gives an additional array gain proportional to the number of elements. A 100‑element 1‑km array adds ≈ 20 dB (×100) → needed output power ≈ 200 W. |

**Bottom line:** A civilization that can build a **kilometre‑scale phased array** and point a **tens‑of‑kilowatt** transmitter toward Earth could reliably deliver a 10‑byte blockchain signature at 100 ly. The required energy is comparable to the total power consumption of a small city, which is plausible for an advanced technological society.

## 4.  Putting It All Together – A “Blueprint” for an Interstellar Blockchain Beacon  

| Step | Design choice | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Payload** | 10 bytes = {Chain‑ID (2 B), Tx‑hash (4 B), Tiny signature (2 B), Epoch (2 B)} | Minimal information that proves “we belong to a known ledger and we control the private key”. |
| **Modulation** | 4‑FSK (200 Hz tone spacing) + (15, 11) BCH FEC | Robust to scintillation, easy to detect in a spectrogram, and requires only modest SNR. |
| **Symbol rate** | 100 symbols s⁻¹ (≈ 1 kHz bandwidth) | Gives 10 bits per second → 8 seconds to transmit the entire encoded block (including FEC). |
| **Transmission pattern** | Re‑broadcast the block 10 times with a 1‑minute pause between repeats | Allows coherent integration and guards against single‑pulse loss. |
| **Transmitter array** | 1 km × 1 km phased‑array, 60 dBi gain, 5 kW RF output (EIRP ≈ 5 GW) | Meets the link‑budget for a 100‑ly distance with a comfortable SNR margin. |
| **Frequency** | 1.420 GHz + 12 kHz offset | Near the hydrogen line (good for “attention‑getting”) but far enough to avoid the strongest galactic background. |
| **Pointing** | Fixed toward the Solar apex (the direction of the Sun’s motion relative to the local standard of rest) | Maximizes dwell time on Earth as the planet sweeps through the beam. |

A modern SETI pipeline (e.g., Breakthrough Listen’s GPU‑based real‑time spectrometer) would:

1. **Ingest raw voltage streams** at 2 GS/s.  
2. **Apply coherent de‑Doppler correction** for a range of drift rates (± 10 Hz s⁻¹).  
3. **Run a matched‑filter bank** for the 4‑FSK tones, integrating over 1‑second windows.  
4. **Decode the BCH block** and test whether the resulting 10‑byte word matches any of the pre‑registered “chain‑ID” patterns (e.g., a table of 2⁶⁴ possible IDs).  
5. **Raise a candidate alert** only if the same block appears in ≥ 3 of the 10 repeats with consistent drift.

### Quick Takeaways

* **Payload size** – The absolute lower bound for a recognisable blockchain marker is ≈ 8 bytes; 10 bytes gives a comfortable safety margin.  
* **Modern instruments** – Unlike the 1977 Big Ear, today’s telescopes record full complex voltages, have sub‑Hz spectral resolution, and can run sophisticated pattern‑search algorithms in real time. Detecting such a beacon is therefore well within the realm of current SETI capability.  
* **Power budget** – An isotropic 23 GW beacon sounds astronomical, but a **high‑gain, kilometre‑scale phased array** reduces the required transmitter output to the **kilowatt** range – a modest amount for a civilization that can marshal planetary‑scale engineering.

If anyone ever decides to *actually* broadcast a blockchain‑based “signature of origin” toward the stars, the design outlined above shows that it can be done **reliably** with technology that is already on the horizon for us, and with energy requirements that are modest for a Type‑I or early Type‑II civilization.
