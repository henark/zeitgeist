# BTFDashboard: Analysis Plan

This document outlines the plan to investigate the website `https://btfdashboard.onrender.com`. This research is the final preparatory step before beginning the grand "Zeitgeist Synthesis." The goal is to understand the cultural and behavioral aspects of the speculative crypto ecosystem, which this dashboard represents.

## Investigation Targets

The analysis of the dashboard will focus on the following areas:

1.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   What specific data and indicators are displayed? (e.g., price charts, RSI, moving averages).
    *   Is social media sentiment integrated?
    *   What is the primary utility offered to the user?

2.  **User Interface and Experience (UX):**
    *   How is the information presented visually?
    *   Does the design encourage quick, emotional trading decisions or careful analysis?
    *   What is the overall tone and culture projected by the site?

3.  **Data Sources:**
    *   What are the likely backend APIs providing the market data? (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance, etc.).

4.  **Community and Social Links:**
    *   Are there links to community platforms like Telegram, Discord, or Twitter where the "BTFD culture" can be observed directly?

This analysis will provide the necessary context on the speculative and memetic "shadow" of the crypto space, ensuring the final synthesis is grounded in a holistic understanding of the Zeitgeist.
