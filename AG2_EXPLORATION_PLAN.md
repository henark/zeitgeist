# AG2 AI Framework: Exploration Plan

This document outlines the initial exploration plan for the `ag2ai/ag2` repository. This investigation is the new, prioritized first step in the "Apprenticeship" phase of the 'Coherent Worlds' studio roadmap.

## Phase 1, Step 1: Initial Repository Exploration

The first step of the investigation will be a high-level exploration of the repository to understand its structure, technology stack, and core purpose. The primary targets for this phase are:

1.  **`README.md`:** This is the most critical file for initial understanding. It will be read to learn about the project's core mission, its key abstractions, and its intended use cases in AI agent development.

2.  **Dependency Files:** Files like `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` will be analyzed to identify the project's Python dependencies. This will reveal the underlying AI/ML libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) and other key technologies.

3.  **Source Code (`src/ag2/` or `ag2/`):** The source code directory will be examined to understand the project's architecture. The goal is to identify modules related to core agent functionalities like memory, decision-making, and inter-agent communication.

4.  **Documentation and Examples (`docs/`, `examples/`):** Any documentation or example directories will be explored to find tutorials, API references, and architectural diagrams that can accelerate a deeper understanding of the framework.

This initial exploration will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to evaluate `ag2` as the core technology for our 'Project Chimera'.
