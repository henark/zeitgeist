# A Unified Architecture for a Decentralized AI Stack

**Version 1.0**

---

## 1. Abstract

This document proposes a unified, three-layer architecture for a decentralized ecosystem dedicated to the transparent, verifiable, and autonomous development of artificial intelligence. The stack is composed of three core pillars, each addressing a fundamental need in the AI lifecycle: `PublicAI` (the Data Layer), `TimeChain` (the Coordination Layer), and `aiXiv` (the Knowledge Layer). By integrating these components, we can create a robust, end-to-end system that sources human expertise for data, coordinates autonomous processes in a trustless manner, and validates the knowledge that AI generates. This architecture aims to provide a viable alternative to the centralized, opaque models of AI development prevalent today.

## 2. The Three Pillars of the Decentralized AI Stack

### Pillar 1: `PublicAI` – The Data & Human Feedback Layer

*   **Function:** `PublicAI` serves as the foundational layer, bridging the gap between distributed human intelligence and the data requirements of AI models. It is a decentralized marketplace for AI data.
*   **Core Problem Solved:** AI development requires vast quantities of high-quality, well-labeled data. Centralized services for this are expensive, slow, and create single points of control.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   A global network of "Workers" contribute data collection, annotation, and validation services.
    *   An on-chain reputation system, using staking and slashing mechanisms (e.g., via Soul-Bound Tokens), ensures data quality and worker reliability.
    *   Crypto-native payments remove international barriers, creating a truly global talent pool.
*   **Role in the Stack:** **Provides the fuel.** It is the engine for sourcing and refining the raw material (data) upon which all intelligence is built.

### Pillar 2: `TimeChain` – The Coordination & Consensus Layer

*   **Function:** `TimeChain` is the master clock and event scheduler for the entire stack. It is a blockchain whose primary purpose is to provide a secure, decentralized, and verifiable consensus on the passage of time.
*   **Core Problem Solved:** Autonomous systems operating in a decentralized environment require a trustless way to schedule events, enforce deadlines, and synchronize actions without a central coordinator.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   A **Proof-of-Time (PoT)** consensus mechanism, likely based on Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), ensures that the progression of the chain is tied to the real-world passage of time.
    *   The protocol supports time-based smart contracts (e.g., "execute function X at time T").
*   **Role in the Stack:** **Provides the heartbeat.** It is the orchestration backbone that allows the other layers to interact in a predictable, autonomous, and trustless manner.

### Pillar 3: `aiXiv` – The Knowledge & Application Layer

*   **Function:** `aiXiv` is the top layer of the stack, serving as a decentralized repository and peer-review system for knowledge generated by AI systems.
*   **Core Problem Solved:** As AIs begin to generate novel scientific papers, models, and discoveries, a new system is needed to handle the scale of submission, and to verify the quality and reproducibility of the results.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   A system for submitting "Research Objects" (papers, datasets, models) to a decentralized storage network.
    *   A token-based system for incentivizing peer review from both human experts and other qualified AIs.
    *   An immutable, verifiable record of the entire scientific process, from hypothesis to review to final publication.
*   **Role in the Stack:** **Produces the insights.** It is the application layer where the final product of the AI's "work"—verifiable knowledge—is shared with the world.

## 3. The Integrated Workflow: From Data to Discovery

The three pillars work in concert to create a virtuous cycle for autonomous discovery:

1.  **Data Sourcing:** A research DAO or an AI developer submits a data request to **`PublicAI`**. Workers on the network are paid to collect and label a new dataset (e.g., "all known protein folding diagrams").

2.  **Autonomous Training:** A smart contract on **`TimeChain`** is scheduled to trigger an AI training run once the dataset on `PublicAI` is marked as complete and verified.

3.  **Discovery:** The newly trained AI model analyzes the data and produces a novel discovery—for instance, a paper proposing a new method for protein folding, complete with a new predictive model.

4.  **Publication & Verification:** The AI autonomously submits its paper and model as a new "Research Object" to **`aiXiv`**.

5.  **Review & Reward:** A smart contract on **`TimeChain`** sets a 90-day deadline for peer review. It automatically offers bounties to qualified reviewers (identified by their reputation on `PublicAI` or `aiXiv`). Reviewers submit their feedback, and once a consensus is reached, the bounties are paid, and the paper is officially accepted and timestamped on the `TimeChain`.

This entire process, from data creation to knowledge validation, can run autonomously, coordinated by a trustless temporal backbone and fueled by a decentralized network of human expertise. It represents a complete, transparent, and community-driven alternative to traditional, centralized AI research.
