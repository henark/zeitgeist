# Verification and Enrichment Plan: Craig Wright Case

This document outlines the first step in the research task to verify and enrich the user-provided analysis of the "Bezos-Nakamoto-Z Equation". This first step focuses on the factual claim regarding Craig Steven Wright.

## Research Objective

To verify the claim: "a British High Court judge definitively ruled in March 2024 that Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto."

This requires finding a primary source (e.g., court documents) or a high-quality secondary source (e.g., a report from a major news organization) confirming this event.

## Execution Plan

The investigation will begin by using the `google_search` tool with the following precise query:

`"Craig Wright" "High Court" "not Satoshi Nakamoto" March 2024`

The results of this search will be analyzed to identify the most reliable source. The content of that source will then be retrieved and summarized to confirm or refute the claim. This process will serve as the first practical application of the `google_search` skill development task.
