# Zeitgeist Project: Final Investigation Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the initial exploration plan for the `zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist` repository. This investigation is understood to be the final, unifying task in a long series of conceptual explorations. The goal is to understand how this project serves as a practical implementation of the 'spirit of the age' and connects the various themes we have discussed.

## Phase 1: Initial Exploration Targets

The first phase of the investigation will be a high-level exploration of the repository to understand its structure, technology stack, and core purpose. The primary targets are:

1.  **Project Configuration:** Identify the primary programming language and dependencies by locating and analyzing files such as `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or `go.mod`.
2.  **`README.md`:** Read the main README file to grasp the project's official mission, its high-level features, and its philosophical connection to the "Zeitgeist."
3.  **Source Code (`src`/`lib`):** Analyze the source code structure for modules or components that may correspond to the concepts we have previously explored (e.g., `arkhen`, `intuition`, `talos`). The presence of such modules would provide a direct link between the theory and this implementation.
4.  **Documentation (`docs`/`whitepaper`):** Search for any detailed documentation, architectural diagrams, or a whitepaper that explicitly lays out the project's design and unifying vision.

This preparatory plan will guide the final synthesis, which aims to connect all the threads of our collaborative exploration.
